# FFT_Accelerator
### Designing an Accelerator to speed up FFT Calculation on FPGA using Verilog

The main aim of this project is to compare the speed and efficiency and the number of resources used after Generating an Accelerator capable of accelerating the calculation of FFT of a sequence using the Cooley-Tukey Algorithm.
Three Different methods were used to generate the Accelerator:
* Software (running on the MiniZed Processor, Used for benchmarking purposes)
* HDL
* HCL

## Result
THe HCL implementation was the most efficient and the fastest followed by the HCL implementation and finally the Software Implelmentation
